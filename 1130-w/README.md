# Learning UIKit

Today, we are going to look at UIKit's major component: `UIView`. In particular, we want to understand sizing and positioning.


There are four video lectures you should watch before starting to work on the challenges:

- `1-slides` & `2-slides` contain a short intro using slides (which are also contained in today's materials)
- `3-playground-demo` illustrates the example from the slides in an Xcode playground
- `4-sample-solution` explains what to do in the challenges and demonstrates an example
